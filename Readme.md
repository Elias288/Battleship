# Battleship

## How to play

    When you log in to the game, all the connected players who can be sent an invitation to play are listed.

    When the invitation is accepted, it will be redirected to the game panel, where the ships must be placed on the grid and upon receiving both confirmations the game will start.

    The player who starts first will be chosen randomly, and will be able to make an attack per turn to the opposing panel without being able to see the position of the enemy ships, being able to see only if the attack hit an objective or the water, having a limit of 3 minutes to do it.

    The winning player will be the one who manages to destroy all the enemy ships.
